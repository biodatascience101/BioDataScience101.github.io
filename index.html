    <p> Biodatascience101 is a Sino-Danish Center sponsored project presenting a series of lectures on biological data-science modelling, visualization and machine-learning in Python.
    The emphasis of these materials is not just to introduce users to practical biological data-science techniques, but also demonstrate
    scientific analysis of results through the lens of academic and biotechnological research.

    This work was supported in part by the Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research (SDC),
    Novozymes and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
