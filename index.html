    <p style="text-align:justify"> Biodatascience101 is a Sino-Danish Center sponsored project presenting a series of lectures on biological data-science modelling, visualization and machine-learning in Python.
    The emphasis of these materials is not just to introduce users to practical biological data-science techniques, but also demonstrate
    scientific analysis of results through the lens of academic and biotechnological research.
        
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
    The work is supported in part by the Sino-Danish Center for Education and Research (SDC),
    Novozymes and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.
