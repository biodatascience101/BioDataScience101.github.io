- name: "Module 2: Data Visualisation - Sequence features for thermostability in proteins from extremophiles"
  description: >
    This module covers efficient data processing in Numpy, analysis and visualisation of biological sequences and graphing in Seaborn and Matplotlib.
    The case data comes from a dataset of 7.7 million bacterial sequences with associated temperature data compiled by the iGEM Potsdam team, collected from the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase and UniProt.
